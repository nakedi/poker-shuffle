     * A very similar algorithm was published in 1986 by Sandra Sattolo for generating uniformly distributed cycles of
     * (maximal) length n.[8][9] The only difference between Durstenfeld's and Sattolo's algorithms is that in the latter,
     * in step 2 above, the random number j is chosen from the range between 1 and iâˆ’1 (rather than between 1 and i) inclusive.
     * This simple change modifies the algorithm so that the resulting permutation always consists of a single cycle.
